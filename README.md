#### By Sowmya Dinavahi and Aubrey Masten

## Description

We created a webpage for user to enter a value and check whether the year is leap year or not using jquery.

## The Following cases were tested to evaluate the program:

The program should return when a year is not a leap year.
  Input Example: 1993
  Output Example: false
The program should return 'true' for years divisible by 4, since those are leap years.
  Input Example: 2004
  Output Example: true
The program should return 'false' for years divisible by 100, since those are not leap years.
  Input Example: 1900
  Output Example: false
The program should return 'true' for years divisible by 400, since those are leap years.
  Input Example: 2000
  Output Example: true
